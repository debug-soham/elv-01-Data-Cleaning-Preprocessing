# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This task focuses on preparing the Titanic dataset for machine learning. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.

## 🔧 Steps Performed
- Explored dataset structure and null values
- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped `Cabin` column due to high sparsity
- Encoded `Sex` and `Embarked` features
- Standardized `Age` and `Fare`
- Identified and removed outliers in `Fare`

## 📁 Files
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` – Raw dataset
- `Titanic_Cleaned.csv` – Cleaned output
- `Data_Cleaning_Preprocessing.ipynb` – Notebook with preprocessing steps
